# keyloggertodiscord

This is a simple keylogger which you can get data from through a discord bot. Start by setting the DISCORD_TOKEN var to your *bot's* token, and the desired filename for the log. (It is defaulted to "default.txt").

So far it doesnt bypass windows defender, which probably isnt a good sign so im hoping to obfuscate it and it would probably be good to change the initial file name too. 

I do not accept any responsibility for misuse as this is for **educational** purposes only.
