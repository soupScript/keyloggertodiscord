# keyloggertodiscord

This is a simple keylogger which you can get data from through a discord bot. Start by setting the DISCORD_TOKEN var to your *bot's* token, and the desired filename for the log. (It is defaulted to "default.txt").
I do not accept any responsibility for misuse as this is for **educational** purposes only.
